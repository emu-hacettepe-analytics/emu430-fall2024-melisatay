## Part 1

First, I found the necessary URLs as a result of the filters specified for the assignment.

-   <https://m.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&release_date=,2009-12-31&num_votes=2500,&country_of_origin=TR&count=250>

-   <https://m.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&release_date=2010-01-01,2023-12-31&num_votes=2500,&country_of_origin=TR&count=250>

## Part 2

At the beginning of my assignment, I identify and call the libraries that I decide are needed.

First, I create my url vector from the html links I have determined by filtering.

Then, I created a dataset by extracting the title, year, duration, score and number of votes for the movies from IMDb and combining this information.

## Part 4

First of all, I converted the list of IMDb's top 1000 Turkish movies into a table with the name and year of each movie using the code below.

Then I created a table by combining the top 1000 Turkish movies and their IMDb scores and sorting them in descending order according to their scores.

And finally I displayed the first 11 rows of the movies data frame sorted in descending order by IMDb rating.
